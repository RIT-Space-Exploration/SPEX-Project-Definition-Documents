# Rovers

## Author: Thomas Hall tjh2822

Design and construction of a mock rover. 
A rover would be an area of space exploration completely new to RIT SPEX, because of this there are a lot of unknowns that need to be answered before starting this project. 
Because of this the project will require a large amount of prototyping and testing. 
The team would look at the talent and skills of RIT Space Exploration and answer the question: what caliber of rover are we able to make. 
It would employ a multidisciplinary team for construction and development. The project would be slated to run for two semesters. 
The rover would be extremely promotable and would look great at Imagine RIT.
