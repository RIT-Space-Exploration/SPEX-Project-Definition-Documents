# SPEX Standard - Project Proposal
This is an RIT Space Exploration Standard defining guidelines for content and formatting of project proposals.

## When should I use this template?
This document is intended for a member of RIT Space Exploration to bring forward an idea for a project to be conducted under the RIT SPEX banner.

## What's the purpose of a SPEX Project Proposal?
The intent of a SPEX Project Proposal (SPP) is to organize and document a project idea and its objectives. In the ideal project life cycle, an idea undergoes an initial research phase where a project _Champion_ and their small team develops the primary objectives and requirements.

## Who should propose a project?
The Champion is the primary author of the proposal and, similar to a Principal Investigator, leads a preliminary team in developing a project idea. The Champion is not necessarily the project manager for a project they propose. Faculty recommendations, advice, and support for a project is not necessary but is strongly encouraged.

## Will my proposal be rejected?
SPPs are not approved nor rejected. SPPs are archived, so a proposal that doesn't initially take off may be picked up by a new team somewhere down the line.

## Is my proposal binding?
In the ideal project life cycle, a proposal defines a set of objectives or deliverables which are fulfilled and discussed in a final report or paper. In practice, this is not always the case but an SPP should guide a project such that feature creep is avoided.
