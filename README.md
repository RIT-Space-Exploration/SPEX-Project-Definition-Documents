# SPEX Standard - Project Proposal
This is an RIT Space Exploration Standard defining guidelines for content and formatting of project proposals.

## When should I use this template?
This document is intended for a member of RIT Space Exploration to bring forward an idea for a project to be conducted under the RIT SPEX banner.

## How do I use this template?
Replace the text in this document with your own information and generate a PDF proposal document by using a LaTeX compiler. For a brief user's guide on using this template and setting up LaTeX on your computer, check [this repository's Wiki](https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Standard-Proposal/wiki).

## Why use LaTeX instead of a regular word processor?
LaTeX is not a word processor. It allows you to write content without worrying about formatting or typesetting -- LaTeX handles all the organization, placement of text, spacing, headings, and so on. It is the de facto standard for technical and scientific documents, and it is beneficial for you to be at least somewhat familiar with using it, especially if you plan to do research in the future.

# What's the purpose of a SPEX Project Proposal?
The intent of a SPEX Project Proposal (SPP) is to organize and document a project idea and its objectives. In the ideal project life cycle, an idea undergoes an initial research phase where a project _Champion_ and their small team develops the primary objectives and requirements.

## Who should propose a project?
The Champion is the primary author of the proposal and, similar to a Principal Investigator, leads a preliminary team in developing a project idea. The Champion is not necessarily the project manager for a project they propose. Faculty recommendations, advice, and support for a project is not necessary but is strongly encouraged.

## Will my proposal be rejected?
SPPs are not approved nor rejected. SPPs are archived, so a proposal that doesn't initially take off may be picked up by a new team somewhere down the line.

## Is my proposal binding?
In the ideal project life cycle, a proposal defines a set of objectives or deliverables which are fulfilled and discussed in a final report or paper. In practice, this is not always the case but an SPP should guide a project such that feature creep is avoided.
