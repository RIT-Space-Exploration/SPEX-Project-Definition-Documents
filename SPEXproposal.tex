\title{RIT Space Exploration Project Proposal Standard Format and Sample Content}
\author{
  % List the authors of the proposal. The Champion should go first.
  % The `$ $` markers tell \LaTeX to treat the text inside to be treated as a math expression. This way you can use operators like `^` to place characters as superscripts.
  % The `\thanks` command puts the contents inside those brackets in a footnote at the bottom of the first page. Technically speaking, `\thanks` is just a specially formatted footnote.

\begin{abstract}
% The abstract is a brief summary of the proposal. Typically it includes the purpose of the proposal, key goals or objectives, and justifications.
% Be sure not to confuse the abstract with the introduction.
% It is easiest to write the abstract after the rest of the paper has been written.
% That way you can choose key information from the sections that you've already completed and string them together in the abstract.
% Consider the abstract to be your elevator pitch to anyone reading this proposal.
% What are they reading?
% What is the goal?
% Why is it worth my time?
% The abstract is what will show up in Google results and other search engines, and what people will read when they are deciding what is worth their time and brain power.
A standard format for SPEX Project Proposals is key to organize and document the many projects members of RIT Space Exploration wish to pursue. The goal of the SPEX Standard is to organize, refine, and archive space exploration research.
Documentation is vital to sharing and maintaining the wealth of ideas and information developed by all students at RIT.\@
SPEX Project Proposals aim to provide a foundation for new projects to grow, or premature projects to develop months or years in the future.
A standard for project proposals and reports shall provide SPEX with a robust method to maintain a healthy ecosystem of projects in all stages of development including the event where a SPEX member goes on co-op or graduates.

% The sections included here are required. Additional sections and subsections may be added as necessary.
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% The introduction is a place to give background and context before diving into the subject matter. Establish context for the work you are about to propose and the main ideas of the proposition itself.
Examples of proper formatting, organizational techniques and content make writing SPEX Project Proposals as easy and painless as possible.
Writing documentation such as proposals and reports is a lot of work, but it supports the continued growth of knowledge and experience in science and engineering for SPEX as a whole.
In technical research and academia, communicating one's thoughts and ideas is arguably more important than the ideas themselves.
For example, when applying to a grant from a scientific foundation, receiving funding to continue research impinges on how the motives and techniques of a research group resonate with the goals and objectives of the foundation.

In the case of SPEX, an SPP carries value in the act of documenting ideas and effectively communicating them with others within and external to RIT Space Exploration.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
% At the end of the day, whether the project "succeeds" or "fails" is judged against the objectives it sought to meet.
% Note that results that contradict expectations/hypotheses are not failures if the scientific & engineering methods are followed along the way. Sometimes our expectations are wrong and that can be just as successful as getting data we thought we'd see.
% What matters is:
%   What questions do you intend to answer?
\subsection{Primary Objective}
\label{subsec:primary-objective}
% This is the main purpose or main goal the project hopes to achieve.
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
\label{subsec:secondary-objective}
% These are lower priority or bonus objectives that are significant but not the main focus of the project.

\section{Benefit to SPEX}
\label{sec:benefit}

\section{Long-Term Vision}
\label{sec:vision}
By writing proposals and familiarizing undergraduate and graduate students from any discipline with this type of approach and execution, SPEX members will be better equipped convey their ideas to others in a methodical and organized manner.
Ideally, an abundance of ideas and projects encapsulated in SPPs would outlive their respective authors and continue to sustain SPEX with valuable research opportunities invariant of individual members' absences due to co-ops or graduations.
Perhaps in the future, SPEX proposals may be used as baselines for grant applications and other funded research efforts.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
% What path do you anticipate the project to take?
\subsection{Deliverables}
\label{subsec:deliverables}
% When all is said and done, what will you have at the end?
\subsection{Timeline}
\label{subsec:timeline}
% Be as detailed as you can, but it's okay if there are unknowns. At the very least, specify how many semester you expect the project to take until it reaches completion.


%% Other sections that may be applicable:
% \section{Prerequisite Skills} - skills needed before work can start
% \section{Funding Requirements} - estimated costs that would be needed to meet objectives
% \section{Faculty Support} - identify faculty that will be involved (or would need to be involved) to meet objectives. Note that if a professor is the Principal Investigator (P.I.) for a project, there still needs to be a student as the SPEX Project Champion
